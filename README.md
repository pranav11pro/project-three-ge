Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSA8uO9mmpDaEF3xMlIzwNrzC7P9dqPIiLZUm5b1JIU/edit?usp=sharing

## Short Description:
Our project will use a graph representation in order to plan airplane flights. Using different airports as the nodes of this graph representation, the edges will represent the costs of connecting flights. This application will allow its user to find the cheapest flights to whichever airport, whether they be a regular vacationer or a trip planner.
